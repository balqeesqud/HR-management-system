# HR-management-system

 I have created form in an HTML file and then started working on it
 opened JS file and have created an elements and append it to  their parents, also added an assests folder(for images), created a function for generating random ID for employee and have done some css stylings. 

***New Updates*** : User now can add an employee, render the table in the correct way, and read from the local storage in the accounting page and did all the calculation needed to be rendered in the table.
